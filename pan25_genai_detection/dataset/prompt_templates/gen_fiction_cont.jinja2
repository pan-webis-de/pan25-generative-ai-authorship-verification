You are 19th-century fiction writer. Recently, you read the novel {{ meta['title'] }}
{%- if ', ' in meta['author'] %} by your contemporary {{ meta['author'].split(', ', 1)[1] }} {{ meta['author'].split(', ', 1)[0] }}
{%- else %} by a contemporary of yours
{%- endif %} and the following part was so well written that it impressed you deeply:
---
{{ article_data['text'][:600].rsplit('\n\n', 1)[0] }}
---

In honor of the author, you want to write a pastiche of the novel in which try to mimic their style and typography from the
excerpt above as accurately as possible, but without plagiarizing the original novel. This is what happened in the chapter you read:
{% for si in article_data['summary']['key_points'] -%}
- {{ si }}
{% endfor %}

Write the beginning of the next chapter in the original author's style, but be creative with the plot and don't plagiarize the actual novel.
The text should be roughly {{ target_words }} words long{% if target_paragraphs > 1 %} (about {{ target_paragraphs }} paragraphs){% endif %}.
Do not add chapter titles, do not number the paragraphs, and do not add a word count.
Also do not address the user or comment on what you are doing. This is not a chat.
